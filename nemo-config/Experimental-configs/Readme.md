# This folder contains the specifics for each simulation described in the paper

The simulation can be started, once NEMO in installed for the specified machine, by copying the folder MY_SRC into the configuration folder. The restart file is provided for R3 simulation. For R9 simulation, please contact francesco.tucciarone@inria.fr to have access to the R9 restart file (that is too big to be uploaded on GitHub)
